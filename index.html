      <h3>Who is Banzoin Hakka?</h3>
        <p>Banzoin Hakka is a VTuber, someone who live streams video content and uses a digital character avatar that displays their facial expressions and body movement using motion capture technologies.</p>
        <p>Like many VTubers, Hakka incorporates roleplay elements into his streams to depict a character. Hakka’s character is an exorcist who belongs to a group called Guild Tempus and lives in a fictional location called Xenokuni within the land of Elysium.</p>
        <p>Hakka's fans love his humour and gregarious personality, his easy-going nature with his community, and his creativity and dedication.</p>
        <p>Including Hakka, there are six active VTubers in Guild Tempus. Tempus is part of the Holostars English branch of the Japanese VTuber management and technology company Cover Corp.</p>

                <!--8/5/24 - scripts/main.js is selecting for "samp" in order to apply a new time to the "Local Time" text; figure out how to use the toLocaleTimeString() output method
                - maybe I should be using <output> instead of <samp>? I just picked <samp> as a test because it's an element that encloses inline text representing sample or quoted output from a computer program. But <output> may be more appropriate?

  <!--8/5/24 - add script to change Hakka's stream time information to local computer time
    - think I may be able to get this to work using the getTimezoneOffset() method of Date instances described in the MDN Javascript/Standard built-in objects/Date guide, and then... adding that number to Hakka's stream time? Hmmmm this seems like a convoluted way to go about it haha
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
    - OH! The toLocaleTimeString() method of Date instances may be what I'm looking for!!
